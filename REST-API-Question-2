How would you design a REST API for an address book? What endpoints will it have (feel free
to provide sample curl requests)? How would you handle errors?

    I would structure the address book with two resources:
        - Person  -> has multiple addresses
        - Address -> can belong to many People but can be accessed independently
    The Person and Address have the corresponding models which encapsulate their attributes.

    In addition, for error handling we could use a Error model which encapsulates a message that describe the reason of
    failure. The HTTP response would contain the corresponding Status Code in order for the clients to handle the
    failure.

        Description: Get a list of people
        Status Code: 200 OK
